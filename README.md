<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>I used the HTML to create the details of my project. It clearly made it possible for me to layout my work in a clean manner as well as the spacing and the indentation.</p>

<p>Then the CSS was to style the elements in the HTML. It has allowed me to secify the positioning , the color, the size , the padding etc of my work.</p>

<p> I also used javascript and bootstrap.Javascript is to enable me create the backend while bootstrap helped in making the site responsive.</p>
<p>After creating the project I used the git tool to host my project in my GitHub account.</p>

<p>In simpler language I used
<ol>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>Git</li>
<li>GitHub</li>
<li>Bootstrap</li>
<li>Javascript</li>
</p>
